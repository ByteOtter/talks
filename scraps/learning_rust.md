# What is Rust?

> Rust is a modern memory-safe system level language.

- Provides low level control over hardware with modern syntax and features
- Memory-safe thanks to its **"ownership"** rulesets
- Interoperable with existing C and C++ codebases

-> Less Risk, same control, more modern language features and eco-system
