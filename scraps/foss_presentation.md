# Why FOSS?

Why not?

---

# Why FOSS?

- **Control** over the software you use and its feature set
- **Security** thanks to thousands of reviewers or being able to review yourself
- **Training** on technical topics; Often used as entry to programming / software engineering
- **Stability** projects do not just vanish if the company behind it stops it
- **Privacy** higher privacy focus thanks to the environment it is developed in

---

## Security

- No security by obscurity
- Many thousands of eyes on the code interested in a secure application
- Every change can be reviewed by anyone at any time
- Many different viewpoints and experiences included
- Pushing malicious code into projects is way harder due to the number of reviewers

---

## Privacy

- FOSS users and contributors love them some privacy
- Much harder for individuals or organizations to push for more telemetry
- Thanks to OSS licenses, forking projects before unpopular changes is an option

---

## Training

- Knowledge is shared everywhere
- No real barriers to entry
- Public record of your skills and interest on GitHub or similar
- Past work and achievements not under NDA
- Experience sharing with some of the brightest minds in their field

---

# How can I help?

- No need to be a developer
- Artists, translators, documentation people, hardware and networking for hackspaces or FOSS events, etc. etc.
