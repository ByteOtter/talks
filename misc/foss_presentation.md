# Task for you

On each slide is a different FOSS mascot or logo, can you spot them all?

# Who am I?

![bg right:40% 80%](../assets/not_committing/me_face.jpg)

- Chris
- 25 Years old
- Appr. Software Engineering @ SUSE
- Experience mostly in Python and Rust
- Open source contributions since 2021/22

---

# What is FOSS?

*"Free as in **freedom**, **not** free beer."*

- Source code and other resources are publicly available
- Little restriction on modification and redistribution
- Built as a collective by people around the world
- Commerical or uncommercial use possible depending on license

![bg right 60%](../assets/images/misc/foss_presentation/open-source-initiative-logo.png)

<!--Solution: The Open Source Initiative https://https://opensource.org/ -->

# What is FOSS?

![top-right-med](../assets/images/misc/foss_presentation/tux.png)

Many important services are dervied from, based off, or are themselves FOSS projects.

- Linux (subsequently Android)
- git (subsequently a lot of "Git forges" -> GitLab, Gitea, etc.)
- Nearly all network protocols
- Basically all Database systems
- All modern programming languages & frameworks

<!--
- Container Engines (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Apache Web Server
- HTTPS, TCP/IP, SSL/TLS
- MySQL, MariaDB, etc
- Python, C, C++, Rust, PowerShell & .NET Core
-->

<!--Solution: Tux, the Mascot of the Linux Kernel https://kernel.org/ -->

---

# Why FOSS?

Why not?

![bg right fit](../assets/images/misc/foss_presentation/opensuse-button-1.png)

<!-- Solution: openSUSE (my beloved) https://get.opensuse.org -->

---

# Why FOSS?

![top-right-med](../assets/images/misc/foss_presentation/love_companion_rustc.jpg)

- Control over the software
- **Security** through peer review
- Stability through review & conservation
- **Privacy** by culture
- **Training** through low barrier of entry

<!--
- **Control** over the software you use and its feature set
- **Security** thanks to thousands of reviewers or being able to review yourself
- **Training** on technical topics; Often used as entry to programming / software engineering
- **Stability** projects do not just vanish if the company behind it stops it
- **Privacy** higher privacy focus thanks to the environment it is developed in
-->

<!-- Solution: The little icon in the companion cube is the Logo of the Rust programming language. https://www.rust-lang.org/ -->

---

## Security

![top-right-med](../assets/images/misc/foss_presentation/wireguard.png)

- No security by obscurity
- Many thousands of eyes on the code interested in a secure application
- Every change can be reviewed by anyone at any time
- Pushing malicious code into projects is way harder due to the number of reviewers

<!--
- Security not left to chance
- Thousands of eyes reviewing changes (random audits potentially)
- Many different viewpoints and backgrounds of contributors
- Discussions are held in the open in issues and bugtrackers
- Responsible disclosure
- Uni banned for trying to push malicious code in Linux kernel
-->

<!-- Solution: Wireguard. A fast, encrypted VPN service. https://www.wireguard.com/ -->

---

## Privacy

![bottom-left](../assets/images/misc/foss_presentation/tor.svg)

- FOSS users and contributors love themselves some privacy
- Much harder for individuals or organizations to push for more telemetry
- Thanks to OSS licenses, forking projects before unpopular changes is an option (-> Brave Browser)

<!-- Solution: The icon of the Tor browser. https://www.torproject.org/ -->

---

## Training

![bg right 70%](../assets/images/misc/foss_presentation/Screenshot_20240311_190646.png)

- Knowledge is shared everywhere
- No real barriers to entry
- Public record of your skills and interest on GitHub or similar
- Past work and achievements not under NDA
- Experience sharing with some of the brightest minds in their field

---

# How can I help?

- No need to be a developer
- Artists, translators, documentation people, hardware and networking for
hackspaces or FOSS events, etc. etc.
